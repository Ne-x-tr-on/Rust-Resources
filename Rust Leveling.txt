Level 1 – Core Foundations

Ownership

Control Flow

Functions

Structs

Enums

Vec Type

Type Casting

👉 Here you’ll master Rust’s basics and memory model. Practice with small projects like a student record system using Structs + Enums + Vec.

Level 2 – Collections & Data Handling

HashMap

Iterator Methods (from Vec)

Input & Output → Error Handling

Error Handling II

👉 Start building CLI apps like a word counter or bank system storing balances in HashMaps.

Level 3 – Abstractions & Reusability

Generics & Traits

Modules

Unboxing Crates (Packages, Modules)

👉 Learn how to structure big projects. Start using serde for JSON, and reqwest for HTTP requests. Maybe build a mini weather app that fetches online data.

Level 4 – Advanced Rust

Closures

Lifetimes

Declarative Macros (vec!)

👉 Try to write higher-order functions, build your own mini macro, and understand how lifetimes prevent dangling references. Great prep for backend dev.

Level 5 – Concurrency & Async

Async + Tokio

👉 Learn how to write async functions and use tokio runtime. Build:

A chat server

Or a file downloader

🔹 How You Can Practice

For each topic, I can:
✅ Generate 50+ easy Rust exercises (like flashcards with answers).
✅ Give you mini-project ideas per level.
✅ Provide real backend examples (using Axum + SQL).

Newton, do you want me to turn your notebook list into a 3-month structured Rust Study Plan (daily/weekly tasks + projects), so you cover everything in order?

You said:
I need to relearn those topics but i dont know whichto start to easily get the oother concept..Explain

Got it ✅ Newton — this is a common Rust challenge. Rust concepts are interdependent, so if you learn them in the wrong order, you’ll keep getting stuck. Let’s organize your list into the best learning flow, so each concept builds on the previous one.

🔹 The Right Order to Relearn Rust
1. Foundations (must start here)

Ownership → core of Rust, everything else depends on it.

Control Flow → if/else, loops, match (needed everywhere).

Functions → how Rust organizes logic.

Type Casting → converting types early prevents confusion later.

👉 Why? Without ownership & basic functions, you can’t understand lifetimes, structs, or error handling.

2. Data Structures (organizing information)

Struct → build your own data types.

Enums → model choices/states.

Vec Type → growable lists, heavily used.

HashMap → store key-value pairs.

👉 Why? These give you the “toolbox” to represent real-world problems.

3. Error Handling & I/O

Error Handling I & II (Result, Option, ?)

Input & Output (reading/writing files, user input)

👉 Why? Once you can model data, you need to safely handle failures.

4. Abstractions & Code Organization

Modules → organize big projects.

Generics & Traits → reusable, flexible code.

Iterator Methods (from Vec) → powerful, clean way to work with collections.

👉 Why? You now know how to build apps, but this step makes them cleaner & scalable.

5. Advanced Concepts

Closures → inline functions that capture variables.

Lifetimes → understand memory & borrowing fully.

Declarative Macros (vec!, your own macros) → code generation.

👉 Why? These are trickier but they only make sense after ownership, structs, and functions are clear.

6. Async & Concurrency

Async + Tokio → real-world networking, APIs, servers.

👉 Why last? Async builds on everything: ownership, lifetimes, error handling, traits, etc. If you rush here, you’ll feel lost.

🔹 Visual Order (Best Flow)

Ownership → Control Flow → Functions → Type Casting → Struct → Enums → Vec → HashMap → Error Handling → I/O → Modules → Generics & Traits → Iterators → Closures → Lifetimes → Macros → Async/Tokio
