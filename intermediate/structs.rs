// ===========================
// RUST STRUCTS PRACTICE QUESTIONS
// ===========================

// Q1. Define a struct named `Person` with fields `name` (String) and `age` (u32).

// Q2. Create an instance of `Person` with the name "Alice" and age 30.

// Q3. Write a method for the `Person` struct called `greet` that prints "Hello, my name is NAME".

// Q4. Define a struct `Rectangle` with `width` and `height` as u32. Add a method `area` that returns the area.

// Q5. Implement a tuple struct `Color` that holds 3 u8 values for RGB.

// Q6. Define a unit-like struct called `Marker`.

// Q7. Create a struct `Student` with private field `grade` and public field `id`. Add a constructor and method to access `grade`.

// Q8. Write a struct `Circle` with radius (f64), and an associated function `new` that returns a Circle instance.

// Q9. Add a method to `Circle` called `circumference` that returns the circumference.

// Q10. Create a struct `Login` with fields `username`, `email` (String), and a method `display` that prints them.

// Q11. Create a struct `Book` with fields `title` and `pages`. Derive `Debug` and print an instance.

// Q12. Define two structs `Point` and `Line` where Line contains two `Point` fields: `start` and `end`.

// Q13. Use the struct update syntax to create a new `Person` from another, changing only the name.

// Q14. Implement a struct `Car` with a method `drive` that takes `self` by mutable reference and increments a mileage field.

// Q15. Define an enum `Role` and use it inside a struct `User` as a field. Create an instance of `User` with a Role.
